<h1>Pavel Durov</h1>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov"> Pavel Valeryevich Durov </a> (Russian: Па́вел Вале́рьевич Ду́ров; born 10 October 1984) is a Russian business executive and entrepreneur.<br> <br>
Along with his brother Nikolai Durov, he founded the social network VK in 2006, which quickly became the most popular social network in Russia.
    In 2014, after a conflict with the new owners of the company and pressure from the Russian authorities, Durov resigned as CEO of VK and
    left Russia for the Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. <br> <br> </p>

<p style="align-content: center">During his university years Durov created the highly popular forum spbgu.ru. In 2006, he met his former classmate Vyacheslav Mirilashvili
    in Saint Petersburg. Vyacheslav showed Durov the increasingly popular Facebook, after which the friends decided to create a new Russian
    social network. Lev Binzumovich Leviev, an Israeli classmate of Vyacheslav Mirilashivili, became the third co-founder. Durov became chief
    executive officer (CEO) and attracted his older brother Nikolai, a multiple winner of international math and programming competitions,
    to develop the site. <br> </p>
